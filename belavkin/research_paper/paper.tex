\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces the Belavkin Optimizer, a novel optimization algorithm derived from the Belavkin quantum filtering equation. We present the core update rule of the optimizer, which incorporates an adaptive damping factor and a stochastic exploration factor. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation by benchmarking the Belavkin Optimizer against standard baselines (Adam, SGD, RMSprop) on synthetic datasets. The results are presented in the form of performance tables and loss curves, and we conclude with a discussion of the optimizer's potential applications.
