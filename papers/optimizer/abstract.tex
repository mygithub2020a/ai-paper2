% Abstract for Belavkin Optimizer paper

We introduce a novel neural network optimizer inspired by quantum filtering principles
from the Belavkin equation. While direct application of quantum mechanics to classical
neural networks is intractable, we develop a computationally efficient heuristic that
captures key information-theoretic insights. Our optimizer implements a unique update
rule combining gradient-dependent damping (analogous to measurement backaction),
standard gradient descent, and multiplicative stochastic exploration (state-dependent
diffusion).

We benchmark our approach on structured learning tasks including modular arithmetic
and sparse parity problems, which exhibit phase transitions and grokking phenomena.
Compared to standard optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop), our method shows [RESULTS TBD].
We analyze convergence properties, computational efficiency, and provide extensive
ablation studies to understand which components contribute to performance.

This work demonstrates that quantum-inspired heuristics can yield novel optimization
algorithms with distinct training dynamics, though we emphasize our approach is a
classical algorithm inspired by quantum principles rather than a quantum computing
application.
